            <p class="overview-label">Challenge</p>
             <p class="overview-detail">This was an extremely open-ended design problem, with unlimited contraints on what creative solution we could present. <span class="ital">In the process of asking "What is 'PHARMA"? with the team, during my research I realized that no one had ever built a visualization of the World Health Organization index of pharmaceuticals considered 'essential' to life. I created the dataset from scratch, and coded a simple yet 'large' data visualization in order to really see and explore the complexity of this finite yet expansive system.</span> This data visualization ended up forming the basis of our cloud concept.</p>
             <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Following group creative strategy sessions, I delved deeper into concepts discussed, conducted thorough exploratory research, needfinding, and design research for further ideation. After honing-in on our 'cloud' concept, we then began ideating how we could actually build a responsive physical installation, and through this, started defining prospective user interactions to create an experiential narrative of 'PHARMA'. Finally, we moved to material research (here the project was handed off to engineering).</p>

It is a <span class="bolder">mixed use area</span> incorporating housing, cultural facilities and hotels. The surrounding area at walking distance from EMA is the Amsterdam Rai Station (for easy commute) and Amsterdam RAI Convention Centre, which hosts up to 500 large international (medical) conferences and exhibitions each year. The Beatrix Park and Amstel Park – both a 5-minute walk – are green spaces for leisure and relaxation. The area is also home to Amsterdam’s oldest football club, a bilingual (English/Dutch) primary school, Amsterdam World Trade Center, and the VU University. <span class="bolder">In the coming years a new residential area will be developed just south of the plot, including facilities such as a school and small retail units as well as offices for (small) businesses.</span></p>

         <p class="process-summary red-process">After visually exploring and mind-mapping the 'cloud', we settled on three key dimensions (knowledge, time, and perspective) to model the cloud around; asking, how can these dimensions be embodied in the scheme and accent this experiential installation?

I could find no diagram or visualization of the index that could help us understand its size and complexity. If we were to create a 'cloud' from this concrete data we needed to know how big it was, how it could grow in size, and what information was available/helpful to our concept to portray. <span class="bolder">At this point I decided to build up the data structure (JSON) by hand from the WHO Index.</span></p>

          <p class="summary-detail">This data visualization of the ATC index is a force directed graph with a single central 'gray' node tagged "PHARMA"; The 14 main categories in the index are then linked to this central node, each node being connected to its siblings down the tree. With increasing complexity of over 1,000 child nodes being in the last branch of the tree, I chose to omit the last layer for visual simplicity and time. Each node can be hovered on to find its name. The visual is also so large that you can zoom in or out of the perspective box. If one holds down the central node, the tree forms with agility.</p>

        <h2 class="red-border">Remarks</h2>
        <p class="specs-detail">This bid project was my first time working with an independent experience design agency with its own holisitc design style. The ultimate challenge was how broadly scoped the proposal was at the start, from the infinite nuber of themes to choose from and type of propsoal (whether an entire complex, building, or instalation). I thoroughly enjoyed concretizing focus, exploring the problem space, and designing for futures. </p>
        <p class="specs-detail">My visualization of the WHO ATC Index turned out to be a side project within this concept proposal. It was the most valuable deliverable in that it created an easy reference for the entire team to conintually go back to while ideating the physicality/digital nature of the design.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">Ultimately, the bid was postponed so I never got to see how this project panned out, but I did hand off all my resources (this page) to the staff industrial designer. At the end, it was clear MMEK' was aiming at a permanent architecturally embedded installation with a digital/physical cloud (AR + Cloud + Floor Reactivity). A lot of the final inspiration/precedent rested on the work of <a href="https://www.studiodrift.com/" target="_blank">Studio Drift</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/8554267" target="_blank">BMW's Kinetic Installation</a>.</p>

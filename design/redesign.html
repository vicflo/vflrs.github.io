            <p class="specs-detail">With only 1 week to redesign such high-traffic apps I spent a bulk of the time researching the products' performance and user experience and identifying UX/UI hiccups and possible solutions to target in their improvement; connecting the product and brand purpose more closely with endeavored impact performance.</p>

            <p class="specs-detail">I created all visual assets for mockups following relevant company identity guidelines and in some cases expanding the brand langauge.</p>

        <p class="whatitis specs-blues">Birds-Eye</p>
        <h2 class="merchant-border">KLM: Overview</h2>
        <div class="surround">
          <div class="overview-div over-left">
            <p class="overview-label">Design Foundation</p>
             <p class="overview-detail">I chose to do the first three screens for KLM (since I do fly KLM). 
            I felt in general that the design was a little withdrawn for a brand that pronounces 'user friendliness' as one of its guiding principles. For this redesign I focused on giving the UI more breathing space, omitting unnecessary words, and creating a more intuitive visual and structural hierarchy that matches the general user’s model of the flying process at the airport.</p>
             <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">From my brand research into KLM’s vision, I found they were/are struggling with staying traditional and professional while updating. I sought to first, align their UI with brand values and pivot the app's UX towards a user's in-airport experience. I added an abstract geometric cloud theme to the app. using circles (to match their crown logo design), with a white gradient. Though clouds might normally be considered cliché, here it feels subtle and feminine (as KLM indicated they desire), calming for first-time flyers, and youthful in the sense that they do not take themselves too seriously as to use clouds.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div over-right">
            <p class="overview-label">Goal(s)</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Energize KLM UI while maintaining a hint of its traditional aesthetic.</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Branding should maintain KLM style of class, allure and confidence.</p>
            <p class="overview-label">App. Needs (according to users and KLM)</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">To be: Open, pragmatic, progressive, lively, fresh &amp; maintain a feminine touch.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="overview-label">Special Sauce</p>
        <p class="summary-detail">I added 3 colors to the KLM palette to help distinguish important content within the UI. KLM had an April Fools’ Joke in 2016 about adding 'orange' to their palette, which the public <span class="ital bolder">loved</span> to which they replied “just kidding!” I found that Rietveld had actually been consulted to design the interior of the planes but that his work was never implemented. I decided to add Rietveld’s colors back to the UI to use as secondary and highlight tones; they are the blue-green, yellow-orange, and green (hardly used). The blue is in the cloud gradient, which actually has the current KLM blue hue within its gradient! I also kept their Danish type NoaLT for headlines and used Roboto for all other informative text.</p>

            <p class="tiny-spec">Behind the Design</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">I focused on expressing brand and clarifying actions for the user: to check in, log in for changes, and create an account. <br><br> I added ‘Check-in’ for the in-transit user who, while at the airport, is tired, rushed, and needs to find their itinerary quickly. <br><br> I removed the duplicate logo atop to better follow Material design (Google recommends not having company branding within the app). I also felt the homescreen was a great chance to shine in terms of look and feel, for this reason I brought their one-liner forward, added a cloud background theme, created a symbol for 'booking' (airplane with a '+'), and surfaced actions from indirect links (such as flight browsing).</p>

            <p class="tiny-spec">Behind the Design</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">For the log in screen, again I maximised the directive quote atop. Made it clear that the user needs to have a 'Flying Blue' account or PIN in order to log in while making it more apparent for them to create such an account as well. <br><br>I wanted this screen to be a little more colorful so I adopted the social log in trend from other applications that were popular at the time to bring out the quick access buttons. <br><br>This screen features a new top bar following material design guidelines and 'active' yellow fromt the expanded Rietveld brand hues.</p>

            <p class="tiny-spec">Behind the Design</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">The 'booking' screen is my dream version of a more informative but minimal itinerary view. Their old screen is a bit confusing in the sense that it shows round-trips as if they are one ticket, which creates confusion if you have already taken the first flight. At a minimum, it should have ‘to’ and ‘from’ and flight times readily visible.<br><br>Clicking on this screen can serve as a drill-down to more information about detailed times and transfers, since we look up dates and time often but not so much transfer time etc. I kept their theme of ‘destination city picture in the background’ here, since it makes it more exciting for the traveler to see where they are going.</p>

             <p class="overview-detail">In general, I chose to approach PayPal with a faithful vision of their user base. From my network, most use PayPal because they need to transfer large sums of money, usually a few times in their life, or rarely on sites like eBay. A large amount of their users are older professionals and attached to the tradition of PayPal, but also entrepreneurs/venture capitalists/business owners. I felt the target audience was accustumed to the dark gender-neutral blues of PayPal with its old-school financial aesthetic.</p>
             <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">For this reason, my redesign is conservative in making large scale aesthetic shifts. However, I did try to add some youthful connotation by slanting the Material of the top sections in the app designs to add some flair to the layout; in addition, this connotes our mental model of a wallet. I also took out the gradients since those they fall outside Material design..</p>

            <p class="tiny-spec">Behind the Design</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">I had a PayPal account that never linked properly from years ago, so I chose to focus on user retention in the on-boarding phase. Here, I sought to make the info gathering process more approachable by adding personalization to direction, reinforcing brand values (tagline), maximising the rewarding feeling of completing a step and reducing visually heaviness (softer hues/simpler symbols).<br><br> I also chose to hint in the desktop version at what PayPal <span class="ital">can</span> do for the user aside from the task they originally came to the site for-- I added a “quick send/request” feature toolbar. Overall I addressed two user personas, the businessman and the social tech-y. I built in the budget finance function since PayPal says they want to eventually do this, but also made it easier to send/receive money for the user in a hurry from one social event to another.</p>

            <p class="tiny-spec">Behind the Design</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">I tweaked their light and dark blues, added yellow for ‘pending’, green for ‘positive/gain’, and magenta for ‘spent’ (magenta because red is perceived as more negative). I clumped the send/request transaction into one task (the action button) since a transaction in code and in life is the same thing whether it is leaving or coming; I hope this analogy helps create a more positive mental model for the user about how their money flows. I also created new icons/symbols for the toolbar as well as one for the action button (fused card/dollar symbol).</p>

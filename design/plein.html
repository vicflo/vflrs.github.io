            <p class="overview-label">Challenge</p>
             <p class="overview-detail">As part of a design challenge to work at Studio Roosengarde in Rotterdam, I was tasked with creating an 'innovative concept'. The assignment: <span class="ital"> What kind of interactive landscape, for a more sustainable world, would you propose if you were working as a designer for our Studio. However you might imagine it, think bigger, bolder, better, than you've ever done in the past. So please think beyond an application using programmable LED's!</span></p>
             <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">I first conducted research to determine an impactful theme for the proposal, after settling on gardening within cities as a topic, I conducted more research to define the tech and level of inovation needed for the futures of urban health and wellness. After defining a schema for integration I followed through and presented a possible expression of the project in Leiden (NL) as an exemplar.</p>

            <p class="overview-detail">Thriv-e Plein (plein being Dutch for 'square') was my concept for the future of an urban eco-concious society. Unfortunatley, the studio couldn't hire me do to one of their investors canceling a project; but the concept did impress! Furthermore, projects of this style and magnitude have begun to pop-up lending more credence to this topic for further innovation.</p>

        <p class="whatitis specs-p">Concept Proposal</p>
        <h2 class="purple-border">A Garden in the Piazza</h2>

        <div class="summary-div">
          <p class="overview-label">Goal</p>
          <p class="summary-detail">A growing city's central interstitial space is transformed into an innovative sensory garden that acts as a centroid for interplay between the private and public. The garden captivates interest and motivates change through each sensory interaction. This urban art installation serves to bridge the gap between our private footprints and the public collective's sustainability efforts, altogether creating an enchanting opportunity for the community to interact and live sustainably for each individuals' pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. I call it 'Urban Supported Agriculture' or USA.</p>

          <p class="overview-label">Observation &amp; Inspiration <span class="bracket">(Why?)</span></p>
          <p class="summary-detail">Strolling through the city and glimpsing through windows, one might find neglected decorative plants wilting in the sills, and largely underused spaces within. We all have some space in our abodes that can be activated as a natural point of interest. Instead of putting up a bookcase, or third-wall to separate rooms, a vertical garden could pop up, paling plants turn into windows of edible foliage, cut flowers become garlic allium centerpieces. Our homes can become the botanical gardens we pay to seek refuge in from urbanity. Not only does nature improve our attitudes, but it can <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930072988" target="_blank">clean up our indoor air</a> (in contrast to the outside). When it's cold and cloudy outside, our interiors can be a potpourri of color and warmth. <a href="https://space10.io/labs/local-food/" target="_blank">With the help of design and tech advancements</a>, our personal ability to grow plants well is now more achievable than ever. To spark the incorporation of nature within the private spheres of our paved cities, I propose a sensory garden construct that inspires and motivates the private transition towards eco-friendly behavior.</p>

          <p class="overview-label">In Essence <span class="bracket">(What?)</span></p>
          <p class="summary-detail">Thriv-e Plein (Leiden-based variation on the sensory garden construct) is an accessible centralized sensory garden that acts as a spring-off point for community innovation and visually relays how the city is doing its own small part through each tiny footprint. In this way Thriv-e Plein, wherever it exists, blurs the lines between public and private, connects the disconnected in the digital age, and brings the <span class="ital">inside</span> out (and vice-versa!). From the central garden, Thriv-e Plein instigates the formation of a de-centralized garden made up of private home gardens. Our homes become their own oases, our communities create their own local markets, and our cities become enriched with the sense of a collective sustainability effort.</p>

          <p class="summary-detail bolder">The sensory garden is an interactive network made up of a central node (exemplary greenhouse), connected to auxiliary node access points (flowers containing thousands of seed pouches). The flowering nodes hold the seasons seeds (to be adopted). The garden's responsive interactions are designed to delight and draw in burgeoning gardeners through all senses.</p>

          <p class="overview-label">Function <span class="bracket">(How?)</span></p>
          <p class="summary-detail">The garden in the central square/piazza/plein first and foremost serves as a beacon and ambient interaction point for the city. Centrally located, it crosses each passers-by's path and begins the magic. It achieves its de-centralization by first providing the seeds (heirloom/organic) to the public. Any person with a smart-phone can then unlock a seed pouch from a specific plant pop-up. They then become a part of a virtual currency-connected network fulfilled by <a href="https://iota.org/" target="_blank">iota</a>, where they receive the tiniest amount for adopting a seed. As the seed grows, and is photographed with the garden app, users receive iota. The user can then harvest their reward (the juiciness of off-the-window-sill taste) or take their produce to a local greenery to exchange for another vegetal, or simply turn in for iota to be used later for purchasing local produce. The central garden then becomes not just a place of sensory wonder, but an interstitial space that gives a sense of accomplishment. The garden (long-term) actively encourages interest by providing seasonal seeds to the community, visually (and virtually) updates on how the city is doing, and grows in complexity with its community's needs as citizens continue on their gardening journeys.</p>

          <p class="overview-label">Motivation</p>
          <p class="summary-detail">In light of Studio Roosegarde's <span class="ital">schoonheid</span> ideal and portfolio innovations, I wanted to propose a project that engages directly with the individual to complement the large-scale impact of their work. With increasing media attention towards climate change and impending statistics, the individual is left with the prevailing notion that there is not much they can do to contribute unless they are rich or a policy maker. I saw a need to provide a metaphorical and physical platform for each individuals efforts to shine; to create something that trickles its way up to changing the status quo, rather than being forcibly applied from above. I grew up without access to dialogue on sustainability and innovative opportunity, but one of my fondest memories was planting a zucchini in our underused suburban back yard, that grew zucchini the size of watermelons: it was magical. To that end, I propose a new re-invigorated concept of the garden for cities to re-inspire everyone living in tiny spaces, and kids who have never seen a plant grow, how to find and nurture their long-lost green thumbs.</p>

        <div class="summary-div">
          <p class="overview-label">Goal</p>
          <p class="summary-detail">Leiden is a sweet yet petite city that carries all the markings of a larger complex architectural cityscape. With ~124,000 residents, Leiden is perfect for an initial launch of the sensory garden. The Dutch are arguably quite far along in their sustainability enterprise, producing 40% of the world's produce through innovative greenhouses (Albert Heijn even gives out 'moestuintjes'). For this reason, residents are already becoming interested in how they can live more sustainably, and through user research/testing, Leiden would serve as a small but mighty example in refining the sensory garden construct.</p>

          <p class="summary-detail bolder">The Leiden concept, 'Thriv-e Plein', models its central greenhouse after the conical form of the near-by windmill <span class="ital">de Valk</span>, while its flowers mimic windmill/turbine forms (though tulips would work as well!). The central sensory garden is like a graph, nodes -> edges, and is best located at Beestenmarkt, a vast open interstitial space, that intersects most citizens' everyday transit within the city.</p>

          <h3>Central Greenhouse(s) Design</h3>
          <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
          <p class="slide-des topper">The Leiden greenhouse is inspired by the local windmill 'de Valk' from the 17th century, visible from Beestenmarkt. Using a conical design, it mirrors the circular theme of the garden nodes. This greenhouse form also exists as locally dispersed greeneries (harvest points) throughout the city. It holds each seasonal plant, serves as an oasis, and employs an expert gardener for all user needs. It also serves as a fixed visible point of how the garden is 'doing'; air quality and impact of the city-wide sustainable behavior is represented in each tiny little LED glow coming from the side panels and alliums.</p>
          <p class="tiny-spec">Materials</p>
          <p class="material"><span class="bolder">Polycarbonate Panels</span>: biodegradable made from sugar and CO2</p>
          <p class="material"><span class="bolder">Sensors</span>: CO2, CO, Ozone, Temperature, Humidity, Particulate (PM2.5)</p>
          <p class="material"><span class="bolder">Twitter Feed</span>: Inspired by San Francisco's <a href="https://twitter.com/karlthefog?lang=en" target="_blank">Karl the Fog</a> the greenhouse keeps city seed adopters up-to-date and inspired.</p>

          <h3>Wind-energy Allium Design</h3>
          <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
          <p class="slide-des topper">Though the greenhouse is modeled after a windmill, the allium form was chosen to generate the wind-supplied energy to supply the garden's energy needs. The allium represents the functional beauty of indoor gardening. Rotated around a spherical form, the turbine rings forms a kind of flower, catching the wind from any angle, giving the sound of wind to the garden.</p>

          <h3>Edges <-> Bloom 'Shadow' Connection Design</h3>
          <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
          <p class="slide-des topper">The floor treatment of the garden is a reactionary point. With two interactions, it first draws the user in towards the flowers (through a sea sparkle shadow/ripple). It then rewards the user who adopts a seed pouch with a sense of accomplishment by lighting up a corresponding tiny LED footprint in the alliums nodes.</p>

The water ripples during the day (using cymatic frequency), but lights up at night due to infrared cameras tracking movement from passers-by (using computer vision). In addion the inlaid 'Shadows' light up where someone is walking using water jets or controlled magnetic marbles in the water to activate the sea sparkle.</p>

          <h3>Flower Bloom Design</h3>
          <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
          <p class="slide-des topper">Each flower is designed to size how many seeds should be offered to the population (and a seed's popularity). Some flowers may be made up of only two layers, while others have all four petal layers. At decresing diameters, the bloom layers nestle to create a water lily-like form. Each layer is closed until the layer below it is empty; when the lower layer empties, the upper one blooms. When a user walks near the flower, scent molecules from the plant are emitted to draw them in with sensation. At the same time, petals can be moved down/up by users to explore. When a seed pouch is removed, it reveals a glowing underlayer. In this way the flower glows more when more seeds have been adopted.</p>
          <p class="tiny-spec">Materials</p>
          <p class="material"><span class="bolder">Leaf/Petal</span>: lined with fiber optics on their edge that light up on interaction. They are filled with toggled (covered and contained) seed pouches that match their theme.</p>

          <h3>Seasonal Seed Pouches Design</h3>
          <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
          <p class="slide-des topper">The seed pouch design is generated from a Voronoi pattern in order to resemble leaf veins. The pattern is fitted first to a petal shape; then seeds are placed in the centers of the pattern cells; then sealed with a corresponding mirror image of the pattern, creating seed pouches to fit into each bloom petal.</p>

        <p class="whatitis specs-p">Looking Back</p>
        <h2 class="purple-border">Remarks</h2>
        <p class="specs-detail">For clarity, foliage and seat-walls integrated in the garden and greenhouse are omitted.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">I chose to keep the space as open as possible so as not to disturb its ability to be a passing-through point, since most open spaces in cities are historic squares and changing them too much would be intrusive and contradictory to sustainable behavior.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">There's a fine line in aesthetically integrating the garden so that it comes across as an inspired place rather than a contraption. Integrating its shape into the landscape is paramount for it to feel like a part of the city. The tiling should preferably even follow the flowers so it seems the garden seamlessly exists there, possibly growing in complexity and covering surrounding buildings.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">The Sensory Garden concept entangles itself with the intuition that if others see people similar to them gardening, they naturally think they can garden as well; it turns the notion that 'if we cannot see it, it is not there' on its head by showing everyone the city's garden.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">Though the garden is meant to encourage real-world engagement with our environment, I see integration of the garden with cryptocurrency as a way to connect the interest in spending time online and spending time gardening. To intersect with this, I chose iota, an IoT (Internet of Things) cryptocurrency which has the potential to create the backbone of a sustainable economy. In this way, users can begin to directly associate a new form of currency with energy. The community needs to be able to trade in an equitable, sustainable way. Creating a new vision of that process is important for novel adoption of the concept.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">Changing perspectives and behavior is challenging, and often slow on the uptake. I chose the garden concept because nature has always had a way of inspiring wonder, and successful iterations of other non-responsive literal gardens have been able to garnish this wonder. The hope is that however the garden construct grows, it can sustain interest with constant presence in our material landscape, slowly but surely molding a responsible, innovative gardening society.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">Indoor gardening can provide some but nowhere near enough food the world will need. However, the hope is that stimulating the gardening community will promote a healthy dialogue and users will become more interested and motivated in incorporating other sustainable ways of living into their every day.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">Air quality indoors can be up to five times worse than outside (according to the EPA). The project contributes to solving this problem by bringing nature back into our homes. In doing so, the project is also useful in promoting awareness regarding air quality and enabling the community improve their local air quality.</p>
        <p class="specs-detail">For some of my design choices, I chose to be a little more pragmatic than flashy, in that the garden should be an example or icon of sustainable uses of technology that can enhance an experience. For example, while it would be 'cool' to have users instagram their plants to cover the blooms of the garden, it is not as energy-efficient or kind to the biosphere to do so. In addition, blue LEDs may be kinder to the eyes, but red is preferred at night because it is less harmful to local fauna. Finally, though having the greenhouse take up the entire space of the garden would allow for creating a controlled optimal atmosphere, it would hinder the uses these central squares already provide.</p>

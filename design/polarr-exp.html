          <div class="overview-div over-left">
            <p class="overview-label">Challenge</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Polarr is an ever-evolving spirit in the creative photography industry. It was daunting and energizing to create a visual framework sensitive to growth while still being recognizable and faithful to the company's values. The greatest challenge, due to startup nature, was developing/refining each parcel of the brand in-tandem with the day-to-day product/company design needs, jumping from logos to components in an instant.</p>
            <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Five years after my first exposure to exploring Polarr's early-stage branding/identity, I picked up where previous iterations left off: a logo, an inconsistent primary hue, and a brutalist font (Nimbus) that did not perform well internationally. We first conducted a comprehensive demographic and taste study of our entire user base. We then held a two-week design sprint to flesh out the foundation of the brand we wanted to create that best aligned with our new mission and user's devotion. Along the way, we defined our purpose, vision, values, promise, voice, and personality. We soon translated these to color, typography, grids, and typography. After this, I fleshed out the rest of the brand: logos, logotype, pattern, design guides, semantics, components, etc.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div over-right">
            <p class="overview-label">Goal(s)</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Ensure that brand promise = brand perception.</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Create an entire brand system beyond logo and type.</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Establish brand consistency across products and platforms.</p>
            <p class="overview-label">Impact</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">
              With renewed vigor of focus on branding and its impact on growth, we were able to re-evaluate each channel of interaction with our users. Some platforms were sunset, sites decommissioned, social accounts redesigned, and products given complete and visually consistent facelifts. Through the process, I also created new protocols for cross-disciplinary and remote collaboration. Most notably, we were better prepared for designing a new portfolio product called Aura under the umbrella brand.

            <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">
              The first visual expression of identity we tackled was color, a favorite feature among users. We knew we needed a full rainbow of hues based on product needs in 24fps and the photo editor. We first defined our primary aqua neon. I then used a CIE L*a*b* colorspace editor to calibrate a full dynamic range from our primary. After this, I tuned each hue to ensure visual distinction and accessibility. Finally, I created shades/tints and color harmonies, cheekily pairing neons with striking pastels.
            </p>
            <p class="tiny-spec">Usage</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">Aqua (sea sparkle) is Polarr's primary color. Color, in general, is used sparingly to differentiate content and provide information hierarchy (particularly regarding CTAs). Orange (peach macaron) functions as a primary complement to aqua while red serves as the error/deleting hue. The full catalog of color is used depending on design needs particular to the context (light mode/dark mode/ornamental).</p>
             <p class="tiny-spec">Accessibility</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">Neons were designed to meet WCAG standards, most being AAA compliant and all being AA for black text on color. In addition, we created primary color variants for aqua and orange in light mode.</p>

              <p class="slide-des topper">From the initial wordmark the 'p', 'o', 'l', 'a', and 'r' forms were defined with the simple logic of restricting curvature to circle partitions and one straight line.

Using the grid, I first formed as much of a letter as possible from arcs cut on the grid, after this, I could slide partitions and articulate the shape with linearity. With this rule-based system, I was able to extrapolate the Chinese wordmark as well.</p>

          <div class="overview-div over-left">
            <p class="overview-label">Challenge</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Developing branding for Aura was a constant moving target. Although we knew filters were our focus (based on emergent behavior of users posting/selling filter creations on Instagram), it was unclear what kind of application we were building. From a standalone marketplace to a social community, I conducted new branding sprints and research for each pivot of value propositions.</p>
            <p class="overview-label">Approach</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">Through each iteration of brand and product experience, I sought to first understand what our creators needed to feel included, motivated, and inspired in Aura. I then ventured to maximize the expression of key design elements that excited them the most, such as real-time filter preview, QR code export, and their profile pages. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div over-right">
            <p class="overview-label">Goal(s)</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Make our 'filter' as recognizable as an image.</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Respect filter creators' desire to convey emotion.</p>
            <p class="overview-detail bolder">Design a effervescent brand to support the community.</p>
            <p class="overview-label">Impact</p>
            <p class="overview-detail">
              After ~6 months of brand-focused iteration for Aura, I successfully found a name for the product with over 80% positive reaction. I created a new iconic form for a 'filter' and redesigned filter exports and QR codes for aesthetics and recognizability.

        <h2 class="medit-border">Designing the 'Filter'</h2>
        <p class="process-summary">While designing the marketplace MVP, it became very clear to me that a 'filter' needed to appear distinctly different from a photo or creator. In designing the filter, being the total focus of the application and love of our prospective community, I wanted to create a logical and iconic shape. Using the conventional forms for a profile and photo, it was a simple 'form follows function' design deduction. What emerged is a lemon-drop/eye. The form works well articulated (flower shape) with multiple filters (as if in a 'pack), connotes the visual, and led ultimately to the logo, increasing recognizability and reinforcing the purpose of 'Aura'.</p>

After multiple explorations and critiques of permuting, coloring, and twisting the shape, I extrapolated a narrative and key design logic for the launch logo that represented the spirit of 'Aura'. We hoped it would reinforce the agnostic feature of a filter, build rapport and recognizability, and inspire the future growth and global perspective of crowd-sourced/inspired aesthetics.</p>

              After numerous expansive rounds of iteration, including those for earlier tentative names, the re-mixed filter logo concept emerged. Though there were many striking variations of filter-focused logos, this dual-sided re-mixed version, ultimately, was perfected for the Beta release. We gravitated toward the optical movement this form evoked through articulation and gradation of hue. This version of the logo we felt portrayed connotations in name and spirit.</p>

            <p class="bolder overview-detail">
              Using the filter-form as a springboard I extrapolated as many different concepts as possible. Holding branding critiques once a week, I first identified the concept, then perfected the side 'cuts', gradation, color, and finally wordmark placement.</p>

            <p class="slide-des topper">Once we saw how impactful the filter lemon-drop form was in the MVP UI, I was tasked with developing a logo based on it. First I gathered visual research (a few shown here), to explore the connotations and denotations the form might have when a creator encounters it. The best logos are often simple yet layered with complexity, the more you look the more you see. In this way, I was able to extrapolate how I could use the filter to inspire different perspectives.</p>

            <p class="bolder overview-detail">
              In considering the name 'Aura', filter form, the connotation of "polar", and visual research (what others might think when seeing or hearing about the product), I immediately knew I wanted to explore movement to encourage the feeling of something static as emanating along with concepts of framing, filtering and or mixing.

            <p class="tiny-spec">About</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">From internal surveys, I synthesized the look/feel the company wanted to achieve with 'Aura' aesthetically (radical yet pragmatic). I then set out to find logos that felt apropos to our genre as well as exuding the 'radically pragmatic' sensibility. After visiting the MOCO Banksy exhibit in Amsterdam, how I should treat the filter form in logo generation became clear. I wanted to situate the logo smack in the middle of homage to photography and contemporary logo form.</p>
             <p class="tiny-spec">Takeaways</p>
            <p class="bolder overview-detail">The most iconic logos of quintessential style brands expressed more passion and complexity than minimalism at the start.

            <p class="tiny-spec">Approach</p>
            <p class="slide-des topper">After multiple rounds of exploration with the filter form, I and the team (through critique sessions) had finally settled on the slide variation as being the most provocative. From here, I created over 500 iterations to explore just how we wanted to articulate the basic concept, how many cuts? How would the sides be partitioned? Are they even in their negative space or cut by the golden ratio? I also took this opportunity to explore wordmark placement as well as basic color concepts.</p>
            <p class="tiny-spec">Takeaways</p>
            <p class="bolder overview-detail">Although we were attracted to the first and last style of sliding filters, we ultimately chose the dual-sided sliced variation for its ability to inspire a turning kind of optical illusion with the eye. From this point, I moved on to experiment and perfect the spacing, strokes, and color.</p>
            <p class="bolder overview-detail">The tilted symmetry of the logo worked better with a stacked variation of the wordmark.</p>

            <p class="slide-des topper">In exploring the usage of color for the Aura app. icon, I had two primary goals, to appeal to the target audience's visual taste and celebrate the brand. With this in mind, I researched fashion trends, music, and filter styles popular with our gen-z creators. At the same time, we conducted an aesthetic research study to identify colors/cultural values shared amongst our users. I then iterated on color combinations using brand colors and trendy pairings. Finally, I led brand critiques to help stakeholders make an informed decision on a color variant.</p>
            <p class="tiny-spec">Takeaways</p>
            <p class="bolder overview-detail">After over ~1000 iterations, 3 workshops, 2 research studies, and 100 home screen tests, we favored the duotone teal/magenta variation. Not only did it have an atypical flair but it aligned with our users' favorite colors (strongly leaning to red and blue shift filters).</p>
             <p class="bolder overview-detail">How impactful color pairings are on the overall tone of the application at first glance. Ultimately we wanted to keep it open for the color icon to change seasonally and/or be personalized by the user.</p>

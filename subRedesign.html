          <p>Goal <span class="quick">:</span> Energize KLM UI while maintaining a hint of its traditional aesthetic.</p>

          <p>Look &amp; Feel <span class="quick">:</span> Clean, punctual, hospitable, friendly, capable, and modern</p>
          <p>Image (should maintain, according to KLM)<span class="quick">:</span> Class, style, allure, and confidence</p>
          <p>Needs to be<span class="quick">:</span> Open, pragmatic, progressive, lively, fresh, &amp; maintain a feminine touch</p>

          <p>Approach <span class="quick">:</span>
          I chose to do the first three screens for KLM as a user with a login (since I do fly KLM). 
          I feel in general that the KLM design is a little withdrawn for a brand that pronounces user friendliness as one of its guiding principles. For this redesign I focused on giving the UI more breathing space, omitting unnecessary words, and creating a more intuitive visual and structural hierarchy that matches the general user’s model of the flying process at the airport.</p>

          <p>I changed their homescreen to support the most common needs: to check in, log in for changes, and create an account. I added ‘Check-in’ for the common traveler who, at the airport, is in a rush and needs to find their itinerary fast. In this home screen, I took away KLM at the top and left the crown: it’s more symbolic, and technically matches Material design more (since Google recommends not having company branding within the app). I also felt like the homescreen was a chance to shine in terms of look and feel. From my research into KLM’s vision I felt they were/are still struggling with staying traditional and professional while updating. I added a sort of geometric cloud theme at the top using circles (to match the crown icon design they already have), with a white gradient. Though clouds might normally be considered cliche, I think here it feels feminine (as KLM wants), calming for first-time flyers, and youthful in the sense that they do not take themselves too seriously.</p>

        </div>
          <div class="bottom">
          <br> </br>
          <p>The login screen is minimal and follows with the same but lighter background from the opening screen for visual continuity.</p>

          <p>The third screen for member login is my version of a more informative but minimal itinerary view. Their old screen is a bit confusing in the sense that it shows round trips as if it is one ticket, which creates confusion if you have already taken the first flight. At a minimum, it should have ‘to’ and ‘from’ and flight times at the first screen. Clicking on this screen can serve as a drill-down to more information about times and transfers, since we look up dates and time often but not so much transfer time etc. I kept their theme of ‘destination city picture in the background’ here, since it makes it more exciting for the traveler to see where they are going.</p>

          <p>Lastly, I added 3 colors to their palette. KLM had an April Fools’ Joke about adding orange to their palette, which everyone loved and they said “just kidding!” I found that Rietveld had been consulted to design the interior but that his work was never implemented. I decided to add Rietveld’s colors back to the UI to use as secondary and highlight tones; they are the blue, orange, and red (hardly used). The blue is in the cloud gradient, which actually has the current KLM blue hue within its gradient! I also kept their Danish type NoaLT for headlines and used Roboto for all other informative text.</p>

          <p>I hope overall it appears more welcoming, less cluttered, intuitive, and minimal so as to calm any stress the user might have regarding flying.</p>

            In general I chose to approach PayPal with a more strict vision of their user base. Most of the people I know who use PayPal, do so because they have to transfer large sums of money, usually a few times in their life, or rarely on sites like eBay. I feel a large amount of their users are older and attached to the tradition of PayPal, but also entrepreneurs/venture capitalists/business owners. I feel the target audience is used to the dark gender-neutral blues of PayPal with its old-school financial aesthetic. For this reason, my redesign is conservative in making large scale aesthetic shifts. However, I did try to add some youthful connotation by slanting the Material of the top sections in the app designs to add some flair to the layout; in addition, this connotes our mental model of a wallet. I also took out the gradients since those they fall outside Material design.</p>

           <p>I designed the overview home screen (after login) for the android and iOS versions, and the on-boarding screen for the desktop view. For the app views, I wanted to support three main needs: to see one’s balance, basic cash flow (so they can see whether they should spend money), and most recent activity/notifications. For the desktop view, I took a different approach; I had a PayPal account that never linked properly from years ago, so I chose to focus on user retention in this process of on-boarding. Here, I sought to make it less frustrating to add a ton of tiny very personal details by making it feel rewarding and less visually heavy (lighter blue, simpler symbols). I also chose to hint in the desktop version at what PayPal can do for the user besides the task they originally came to the site for-- I added a friendly tagline and created a “quick send/request” feature toolbar. Overall I addressed two user personas, the businessman and the social tech-y. I built in the budget finance function since PayPal says they want to eventually do this, but also made it easier to send/receive money for the user in a hurry from one social event to another.
           </p>

          <p>In general I changed their light and dark blues, added yellow for ‘pending’, green for ‘positive/gain’, and magenta for ‘spent’ (magenta because red is perceived as more negative). I clumped the send/request transaction into one task (the action button) since a transaction in code and in life is the same thing whether it is leaving or coming; I hope this analogy helps create a more positive mental model for the user about how their money flows in society. I also created new symbols for the toolbar as well as one for the action button (the card/dollar symbol).</p>

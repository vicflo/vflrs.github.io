          <p>
            <a href="http://solardecathlon.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Start.Home</a> is Stanford's net-zero solar powered 1,000 sqft home entrant for the 2013 US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon. Start.Home's core philosophies emphasized the importance of an energy efficient home that not only grows with its owner, but encourages its residents to make positive behavior change continuously.
          </p>
          <p>
            As CS lead for two years, I served on the core team and worked with all discplines to define how the home would utilize technology. Working closely with a behavorist from the d.school and Project Manager Derek Ouyang, the monitor and control app. for the home took on a life of its own and soon helped model a general interaction design approach for all products in the home. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After two years of research and design, the team decided to create a real-time data visualization webApp, not only for monitoring and control purposes but also for behavior change, continuously adapting to the user's needs over time. As such, time and energy resources were the main focus of the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for the webApp. to best serve the user, the cs team worked closely with the ME and EE teams to ensure access to appropriate data points. Research showed that user's made more positive change if they were given more than aggregate usage to act upon. The team wished to focus in on tasks in order to inform the user when it was their entertainment or showering that used too much power. Because of the need for granular and time sensitive data, the home had over 7 circuits, temperature sensitive water sensors, along with luminance and air quality sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The webApp. focused on visualizing energy in multiple views and aggregations per past, present, and future views; monitoring and control were combined as closely as possible to the recognition/action point. The ambient view acted as a screensaver for the system. Working from a clock metaphor, energy is visualized per hour (a kind of radial bar graph), per resource. The clock can be transformed to emphasize different aspects of the daily energy usage, or the user can immediately bypass the ambient by touching the portion of the abstracted home's floorplan to go directly to room level control and monitoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project went through a wide variety of concepts and implementation designs, with the cs team constantly changing. It is the process of this app.'s life along with the Start.Home that is most interesting in envisioning the future of sustainability.

            Contribution <span class="quick">:</span>&nbsp;I was a part of the team since Stanford's proposal to the DOE in 2011. Working closely with the project manager as the CS Lead, the cs team went through many interested students and academics. I was responsible for managing the team, as well as playing an active part in the core team for Stanford Solar Decathlon (one person per discipline). I contributed most to developing an interaction design model and approach for the home through the design of the energy feedback system. All graphics and concepts were developed and explored by me through the iterations and ideation support of other main contributers.
